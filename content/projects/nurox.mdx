## The Project

## How It Works

Traders use the platform to create journal entries for each trading session, documenting their emotional state, market conditions, decisions made, and outcomes. The platform organizes these entries chronologically, allowing users to review their trading history, identify patterns in their behavior, and track their psychological development over time.
